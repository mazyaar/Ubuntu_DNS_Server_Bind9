# Ubuntu_DNS_Server_Bind9

***Introduction***

***An important part of managing server configuration and infrastructure involves maintaining a way to find network interfaces and IP addresses by name. One way to do this is to set up a proper Domain Name System (DNS). Using fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), instead of IP addresses, to specify network addresses optimizes the configuration of services and applications, and increases the maintainability of configuration files. Setting up your own DNS for your private network is a great way to improve the management of your servers.***

***In this tutorial, you will set up an internal DNS server using two Ubuntu 20.04 servers. You will use the BIND name server software (BIND9) to resolve private hostnames and private IP addresses. This provides a central way to manage your internal hostnames and private IP addresses, which is indispensable when your environment expands to more than a few hosts.***
